    <h1>end of support (eos)</h1>
    <p>Oftentimes, after enough time has passed, a series can become outdated or even broken. The series can be updated to correct the issue(s), or it may reach end of support.</p>

    <h2>How does that affect a series?</h2>
    <p>Once a series has reached it's end of support:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It will no longer be updated, even if there are breaking changes</li>
        <li>You can no longer receive help in the comments sections of videos</li>
        <li>You may no longer be able to receive help in the Discord server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A series will often have stopped taking requests by the time it reaches end of support.</p>

    <h2>What causes a series to lose support?</h2>
    <p>A series may lose support if it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is superceded by a newer series</li>
        <li>Is rendered useless by breaking changes</li>
        <li>Has been live for 2 years or longer*</li>
        <li>Is particularly unpopular</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*If a series is particularly popular, it may receive support for longer than 2 years.</p>

    <h2>What if I still need help?</h2>
    <p>You may still be able to get help for a series in the Discord server if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You've extended the functionality of the application beyond the scope of the series</li>
        <li>The series still receives a lot of help requests, despite being no longer supported</li>
        <li>The series was not superceded by a newer one</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that unless otherwise stated, end of support means you <b>should no longer expect</b> to receive help. It does not mean you will definitely not be able to receive it.</p>
